Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.",

        "Description": "The past few years have shown that antisemitism is alive and well in the United States, in spite of a decades-long lull. While the Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Newark shootings, and the Hanukkah attack in Monsey show are the most violent expressions of antisemitism that this country has ever seen, these are not the only times during which Jews were identified as outsiders and a threatening presence. This course will examine Jewish exclusion through the mid-20th century including General Grant\u2019s expulsion of Jews, the Leo Frank lynching and Henry Ford\u2019s Dearborn Independent, Father Coughlin\u2019s antisemitic radio addresses, the Nazi rally and Madison Square Garden. Finally, it will explore the recent rise in antisemitism and relationship between white supremacy and antisemitism.",

        "Description": "When European empires expanded to the New World, their ships carried Jews to North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Jews were relegated to a marginalized group in Europe, but the New World opened up opportunities. They owned plantations and participated in extensive trading enterprises in the New World, including sugar cultivation, the triangulated slave trade, trade in precious gems, and the fur-trade. This course will investigate the ways in which Jews participated in colonial environments in the 16th-18th centuries: their business pursuits and their interactions with Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans. It will also explore Jews' improved status in diverse New World environments, and the ways Jews created hybrid communities in environments formerly devoid of Jewish life.",

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.",

The course starts with how understanding of light spectrum that is generated due to heat started the development of the field of quantum mechanics by Max Planck. This is then to include a quantum theory of light, on which basis absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission are explained. Interaction of light with semiconductors is analyzed and shows how lasers, LEDs and photodetectors work, and how modern photonics is able to solve great challenges of humanity, such as lighting or optical data communication.",

What contextual conditions enable such mobilization, and under what conditions does mobilization decline? Finally, do movements actually matter for bringing about change? This course is designed to gain leverage on these questions by surveying an eclectic literature from international relations and comparative politics.",

The course opens with a brief review of the fundamentals of crime mapping, then moves into some of the more advanced mapping/software applications that support complex analyses and visualizations. Students will learn to manipulate attribute tables, select by spatial locations, create spatial buffer and distance surfaces, convert vector data to raster data, and assess for spatial autocorrelation and clustering. They will also learn to detect and work with spatial outliers.",

Each week, students will study a policing topic in class and then participate in a simulated police activity hosted by Drexel police officers. These simulated activities include car stops, shoot-don't-shoot scenarios, responding to mass shooting events, and drug seizures. Ultimately, this course hopes to integrate two aspects of American policing that are typically separated: How we teach policing, and how we do policing.",

Amongst other examples, we will examine the role of the US, the impact of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on democracy in the region, and the role of Islamic and women\u2019s movements in the recent Arab uprisings. The course will cover Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran among others.",

        "Description": "Extremist rhetoric and divisive politics seem to go hand-in-hand in today\u2019s public deliberations. The media so often pair the word rhetoric itself with the pejorative adjectives mere, empty, and deceptive, that anything rhetorical becomes vilified. This course draws from the ancient accounts of rhetoric and the contemporary studies on rhetoric to rehabilitate it as a way to inform our efforts towards a more civil public discourse. This course also will host guest speakers from local civic and political organizations who engage in rhetorical practices in the service of civic engagement, which includes the discourse both of people who exercise political power and of citizens who debate over public policies and cultural identity.",

During the course students will have to play the role of a forensic scientist, applying the knowledge that they will learn each week to see if they can determine who committed the crime. Case studies from real crimes will also be used to illustrate the points being made.",
