        "Description": "In this course students will work on launching their own business. Students will spend the term de-risking their business assumptions through various tasks, such as surveying their customer base, meeting with partners and competitors, building prototypes, and validating a market need. Students will learn the iterative process of how a start-up actually works by using the Lean Start-Up model of new-venture development. Finally, students will see how to rapidly iterate a product or service to build something customers will use and buy.",

Power distribution networks are presented with a focus on the different distribution architectures and output impedance characteristics. Techniques to reduce power supply noise are also provided. A secondary focus examines substrate noise in mixed-signal systems and techniques to reduce substrate noise.",

An umbrella term, new materialism refers to a variety of recent attempts to re-imagine nature, sex, body, and matter. During the \"linguistic turn\" of the 20th century, many postmodern feminists retreated from these materials and their associated sciences; enamored of texts but allergic to bodies, postmodern feminists tended to embrace radical constructivism and reject scientific methods and knowledges. Today, new materialists return to biology, nature, sex, body, and matter in order to move beyond the logics of essentialism and somatophobia. This course will survey the results of this return with a special emphasis on understandings of sex and sexual difference.",
